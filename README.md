This is a high performance, nifty, command-line tool written in c++ to navigate through the filesystem. It can be used to -

- Find Directories, Symlinks and Files by their full/partial name.
- Find the sizes of Directories recursively.
- Find permissions of Filesystem Entries (POSIX-style permissions only).
- General Navigation and exploration of the filesystem through the command-line.

## Usage
    fss [PATH] [options] [-r [DEPTH]] [-S|--search|--search-noext|--contains PATTERN]

## Options

    -r, --recursive             Recursively scan directories (can be followed by a positive integer to indicate the depth)
    -p, --permissions           Show permissions of all entries
    -t, --modification-time     Show time of last modification of entries

    -f, --files                 Show Regular Files (normally hidden)
    -l, --symlinks              Show Symlinks (normally hidden)
    -s, --special               Show Special Files such as sockets, pipes, etc. (normally hidden)

    -d, --dir-size              Recursively calculate and display the size of each directory

    -a, --abs                   Show the absolute path of each entry without any indentation

    -S, --search                Only show entries whose name completely matches the following string completely
        --search-noext          Only show entries whose name(except for the extension) completely matches the following string completely
        --contains              Only show entries whose name contains the following string completely

    -e, --show-err              Show errors
    -h, --help                  Print Usage Instructions

```PATH``` is the path to the directory from which to start the scan.

Only one of the search options(```-S```, ```--search```, ```--search-noext```, ```--contains```) can be set at a time.

The argument after the search flag is treated as the search pattern.

## Examples

Print the directories in the current directory, recursively going down two levels -

    fss -r 2

Print the contents of ```/proc```, including files, symlinks and special files with their permissions -

    fss "/proc" -f -l -s -p

Recursively search for all directories named ```proc``` in ```C://``` and show their sizes, last modification times -

    fss "C:/" -r -d -t -S "proc"

## How to Build

### Dependencies

- Cmake (version 3.16 or above)
- Build system such as Make or Ninja
- Compiler with c++20 support

CMake has been used as a build system generator. Create a build directory in the root ```AgFileSystemScanner``` directory and run the following command to configure CMake -

    cmake -S .. -B .

Then, to build the main executable, the following command can be run (in the build directory itself) -

    cmake --build .

If the generator or compiler-toolchain needs to be changed, it can be done while configuring CMake. For example, to use NMake as a generator and GCC for compilation on Windows (instead of VS proj and the MSVC compiler), the command can be modified as follows -

    cmake -S .. -B . -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++

The generated program is ```build/src/fss``` (on Linux/MacOS) or ```build/src/fss.exe``` (on Windows).



## How to generate Documentation

Doxygen has been used for documentating this project. The HTML files can be generated by running the following command in the ```docs``` directory -

    doxygen config
